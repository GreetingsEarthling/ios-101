# Prework - *About ME*

Submitted by: **Jason Fuentes**

**About ME** is an app that contains 3 labels and a button. These
labels contain information about my name, univerity, and career I am pursuing. Within the app
there is also a button that upon clicking, allows you to change the background color. The possibilities
are ENDLESS, kinda... thanks to the randomized RGB colors within the app's code, it is highly likely that you will 
see a new color you have not seen before when clicking.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

- [x] Users see a screen with three labels and a button

### App Idea

  I'm a big fan of a mobile game named "Brawl Stars" and so I would like to build an application 
  tracks the stats of players in the game. At the landing page the app will display the available maps 
  in the game as well as the best brawlers to use for each map. There will also be a separate section containing
  a timeline of bug fixes, balance changes (nerfs/buffs), maintenance notices, as well as tweets/posts 
  from the games official pages that notifies users of game news. 

  As the game does contain lore, I would like to utilize OpenAI's API and basically train the AI with 
  knowledge on the entirety of the game's lore. This will allow the user to have conversations with each of the games characters,
  or commonly known as 'brawlers' and interact with them in to extract certain pieces of lore. 

  But moving back to the main premise of the app, in the game each user contains a unique tag. Using Brawl Stars API I can
  track users matches, if they won or not, as well as the trophies earned/lost. It provides a variety of information.
